         <p>
            In the late 1990s, Air Force senior leadership recognized the need to design an official symbol and develop a centralized theme to encourage young people to join, encourage airmen to stay, and to build understanding, appreciation, and support for America's Air Force. They directed a commercial company, specializing in corporate branding, to research and develop a unique symbol. Company representatives traveled throughout the Air Force and to major U.S. cities to conduct research and become intimately familiar with the Air Force and its culture, environment, and heritage. 
            The new Air Force symbol is based on the familiar World War II "Hap" Arnold wings and represents the service's heritage. The symbol’s modern design represents the Air Force’s present and future leading edge capabilities defending the United States.

         <h2>US Army Symbol History</h2>
         <img src="images/thUGCVD106.jpg" alt="US Army symbol">

         <p>
            The Army Seal was used originally during the American Revolution to authenticate documents. It displayed the designation "War Office", which was synonymous with Headquarters of the Army, and the Roman date MDCCLXXVIII (1778) the first time it was used. It remained unchanged until 1947, when the War Office banner was replaced with "Department of the Army" and the date was changed to 1775, the year in which the Army was established. The seal embodies the Army's ideals of loyalty, vigilance, perseverance, truth, courage, zeal, fortitude, remembrance, determination, constancy, achievement, dignity, and honor. The changes were legislated by the National Security Act of 1947, and authorized by Section 3011, Title 10, United States Code. 
            Prior to the establishment of the "Department of the Army Emblem", 
            there was no official display item to identify the Army. The Seal had traditionally been used to authenticate documents only and was not authorized for public display.
            In recognizing the need to provide a display item, the Secretary of the Army approved the emblem design as the official emblem 
            to represent the Army on January 29, 1947. The central element of the seal and emblem, the Roman cuirass, is a symbol of strength and defense.
            The sword, esponton (a type of half-pike formerly used by subordinate officers), musket, bayonet, cannon, cannonballs, mortar, and mortar bombs are representative of Army implements. 
            The drum and drumsticks are symbols of public notification of the Army's purpose and intent to serve the Nation and its people. 
            The Phrygian cap (often called the "Cap of Liberty") supported on the point of an unsheathed sword and the motto "This We'll Defend" on a scroll 
            held by the rattlesnake is a symbol depicted on some American colonial flags and signifies the Army's constant readiness to defend and preserve the United States. 
            The symbolism for the elements of the emblem is the same as for the seal with the deviations and additions noted under “Description” above: 
            The colors of the design elements are those traditionally associated with the ideals of the United States and of the U.S. Army.
            The flags are depicted in their approved colors. Blue is symbolic of loyalty, vigilance, perseverance, and truth. Red denotes courage, zeal, and fortitude. 
            White alludes to deeds worthy of remembrance. Black is indicative of determination and constancy. Gold represents achievement, dignity, and honor.

      <h2>US Navy symbol history</h2>
      <img src="images/navy1.png" alt=US Navy emblem>
      <p>
         The history of the United States Navy divides into two major periods: the "Old Navy", a small but respected force of sailing ships that was also notable for innovation in the use of ironclads during the American Civil War, and the "New Navy", the result of a modernization effort that began in the 1880s and made it the largest in the world by the 1920s. 
         The United States Navy claims 13 October 1775 as the date of its official establishment, when the Second Continental Congress passed a resolution creating the Continental Navy. With the end of the American Revolutionary War, the Continental Navy was disbanded. Under first President George Washington threats to American merchant shipping by Barbary pirates from four North African Muslim States, in the Mediterranean, led to the Naval Act of 1794, which created a permanent standing U.S. Navy. The original six frigates were authorized as part of the Act. Over the next 20 years, the Navy fought the French Republic Navy in the Quasi-War (1798–99), Barbary states in the First and Second Barbary Wars, and the British in the War of 1812. After the War of 1812, the U.S. Navy was at peace until the Mexican–American War in 1846, and served to combat piracy in the Mediterranean and Caribbean seas, as well as fighting the slave trade off the coast of West Africa. In 1845, the Naval Academy was founded at old Fort Severn at Annapolis, Maryland by the Chesapeake Bay. In 1861, the American Civil War began and the U.S. Navy fought the small Confederate States Navy with both sailing ships and new revolutionary ironclad ships while forming a blockade that shut down the Confederacy's civilian coastal shipping. After the Civil War, most of its ships were laid up in reserve, and by 1878, the Navy was just 6,000 men. 
         In 1882, the U.S. Navy consisted of many outdated ship designs.<br> Over the next decade, Congress approved building multiple modern steel-hulled armored cruisers and battleships, and by around the start of the 20th century had moved from twelfth place in 1870 to fifth place in terms of numbers of ships. After winning two major battles during the 1898 Spanish–American War, the American Navy continued to build more ships, and by the end of World War I had more men and women in uniform than the British Royal Navy[citation needed]. The Washington Naval Conference of 1921 recognized the Navy as equal in capital ship size to the Royal Navy, and during the 1920s and 1930s, the Navy built several aircraft carriers and battleships. The Navy was drawn into World War II after the Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, and over the next four years fought many historic battles including the Battle of the Coral Sea, the Battle of Midway, multiple naval battles during the Guadalcanal Campaign, and the largest naval battle in history, the Battle of Leyte Gulf. Much of the Navy's activity concerned the support of landings, not only with the "island-hopping" campaign in the Pacific, but also with the European landings. When the Japanese surrendered, a large flotilla entered Tokyo Bay to witness the formal ceremony conducted on the battleship Missouri, on which officials from the Japanese government signed the Japanese Instrument of Surrender. By the end of the war, the Navy had over 1,600 warships. 
         After World War II ended, the U.S. Navy entered the 45 year long Cold War and participated in the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the First Persian Gulf War, and the Second Persian Gulf War / Iraq War. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1990-91, the Soviet Red Navy fell apart, which made the United States the world's undisputed naval superpower. 
         Nuclear power and ballistic missile technology led to new ship propulsion and weapon systems, which were used in the Nimitz-class aircraft carriers and Ohio-class submarines.
            By 1978, the number of ships had dwindled to less than 400, many of which were from World War II, which prompted Ronald Reagan to institute a program for a modern, 600-ship Navy.
            Today, the United States is the world's undisputed naval superpower, with the ability to engage and project power in two simultaneous limited wars along separate fronts.

      <h2>US Marine Core symbol history</h2>

      <p>
         The history of the emblem started in 1775. The original emblem was built around a fouled anchor. Although more than 200 years has passed since then, the USMC symbols were modified less than 10 times. Surprisingly enough, only one of these modifications took place in the previous century (1954).
         What does the symbol mean USMC?
         The Eagle, Globe and Anchor emblem, which is nicknamed EGA, has a deep symbolic meaning. The Eagle, the symbol of the US, emphasizes that the organization serves its native country. The globe, on which the Americas can be seen, conveys the idea of the USMC’s interest in international affairs. The oldest of the symbols in the EGA emblem, the anchor, is there to represent the connection with the U.S. Navy.

      <h2>US Coast Guard symbol history</h2>
      <img src="images/thAFGMA6WK.jpg" alt="US Coast Guard emblem">
      <p>
         The history of the United States Coast Guard goes back to the United States Revenue Cutter Service,
         <br>which was founded on 4 August 1790 as part of the Department of the Treasury. 
         <br>The Revenue Cutter Service and the United States Life-Saving Service were merged to become the Coast Guard
         <br>per 14 U.S.C. § 1 which states: "The Coast Guard as established January 28, 1915, shall be a military service 
         <br>and a branch of the armed forces of the United States at all times." In 1939, the United States Lighthouse Service
         <br>was merged into the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard itself was moved to the Department of Transportation in 1967,
         <br>and on 25 February 2003 it became part of the Department of Homeland Security. 
         <br>However, under 14 U.S.C. § 3 as amended by section 211 of the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act 
         <br>of 2006, upon the declaration of war and when Congress so directs in the declaration, 
         <br>or when the President directs, the Coast Guard operates as a service in the Department of the Navy.
